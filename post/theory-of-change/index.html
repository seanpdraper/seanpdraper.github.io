<p>In the end it came as no surprise to me. The Oilers wanted to go in a different direction, and so did I. Twenty years is a long time to be in the same role in the same organization. When Glen Sather hired me away from the National Hockey League Players’ Association in 1998 he gave me the title “Director of Research, Analysis and Software Development” - and that’s pretty much what I did. If ever there was a career path destined to lead into <strong>Data Scientist</strong> this was it. I started down this path at the University of Ottawa where I had completed my Masters Degree in Sports Psychology and was on my way to a PhD in Psycho-pedagogy when I realized I had stopped caring about the topic of my dissertation (A comparison of the structure of knowledge of ice hockey coaches to symphony orchestra composers). I had been hired as a sessional instructor to teach research methods and statistics classes and I found teaching vastly more stimulating than my PhD. I was good at it. Students were transferring into my classes from other departments, and I was given more classes to teach. I taught probability, hypothesis testing, regression and correlation in SPSS 7.0.</p>
<p>Looking back, it was the technology and the data that fueled my passion. While other students saw research methods and statistics as a terrifying and confusing means to an end, I saw my career path. If I could excel at something that frightened so many of my peers I would be set for life. The fact that I loved what I was doing was a bonus. Driven by data and technology it was not long before I found my way into programming - I started app development Visual FoxPro and that was enough to get me hired by the Quebec Nordiques to help them build out their scouting system (OK, that and the fact my father was their Chief Scout at the time). FoxPro was like a gateway drug for me, and soon led to Visual Studio and SQL server. I was teaching myself so I decided Visual Basic was a better choice than any of the “C” languages. Then the iPhone came along and everyone wanted mobile apps so I left the Microsoft world and started to program for Apple devices, first in FileMaker, then in XCode.</p>
<p>People seem to think “Analytics” did not exist in sports until the movie “Moneyball” came out. I would disagree. We had been analyzing the draft and player performance (both on and off-ice) for as long as I was with the team. The movie and subsequent explosion of bloggers forced NHL teams to use the word “Analytics” when talking to the media to ensure their fans knew their team was on the cutting edge. Some teams had consultants, some had an “analytics guy” others held firm to their gut instinct. Ah, the gut instinct. Most people on the hockey side of management are former players, and math was probably not the option they picked in high school. You spend more time explaining fundimental concepts than you do communicating the findings of your research, and what little time left for your research is mostly spent dealing with “well, this one player I remember…” They were quick to jump to anecdotes to make their point, and even quicker to jump on the one player who proved to be the exception to the trend. The better scouts and management would try to understand and make use of the research, but many would ignore anything that went against their gut instincts and then cherry pick the one thing that supported their position, ignoring all else.</p>
<p>Along the way I connected to just about every database format in existence (and a few that are now extinct). Remember lotus notes? The NHL marketing department made a deal with IBM, so for years after Notes had faded into obscurity we were still using it to run the league. Notes must have been bad if scraping websites, parsing JSON, XML and building XSLT made me happy! By 2016 things were running smoothly. I had all the data I could want, I had all the platforms I thought I needed to build apps. Then I found R. R Studio sat on my computer for 6 months before I had the opportunity to really play with it. Knowing what was required to learn a new programming language, I really had to see the benefit before committing myself to the task. The NHLSCRAPEr package provided me all the motivation I needed. Very quickly R replaced most of my development platforms - it was easier to build tidy data outside FileMaker and then pull in my clean data to whatever app I had built. I was content, for a little while, until Shiny came along and made me abandon my application development.</p>
<p>The volume of data available in hockey has grown exponentially. Goals, assists, points, PIMs have now expanded to 3000+ “micro events” captured by complex pattern recognition algorithms. The amount of data extracted from a single hockey game has become unmanageable. I went to R Studio::conf 2018 and attended the Applied Machine Learning workshop to develop a plan to deal with all that data. I went in to my 20th and final NHL Entry Draft with the Edmonton Oilers armed with a Bayesian probability analysis of drafted player success and a complete breakdown of every player rating, assessment, skill set, all hosted on shinyapps.io.</p>
<p>It was here the Oilers decided to go in another direction.</p>
<p>The company had “right-sized” roughly 1/3rd of their staff earlier in the season - Somebody had sold the owner on the idea Oilers Entertainment Group was destined to become the next “L.A. Live” simply by moving into their new downtown arena. This new company needed many senior vice presidents, as well as offices in New York and Los Angeles. Fast forward a couple years and the promised global entertainment powerhouse was showing no signs of bearing fruit. Hence the “right-sizing.” And you can’t get rid of all those new senior vice presidents, they are too valuable, so you have to cut the people who actually know how to do things, and in March of 2018 that is what OEG did. I was at the dentist the morning security escorted 40 people out of the building, but I heard about it quickly enough. I didn’t really know what to expect when I showed up that afternoon, but as it turned out, they did not make any changes in Hockey Operations. They saved those changes until after the draft - which makes sense because you probably don’t want to remove the guy who runs your draft until after the draft. In the end, they let the “coders” go - those of us who could build things, and kept a much smaller staff of “users” - those who could login to a website and download a report, those who could Google something for management.</p>
<p>At this point in the story Data Science was about to run right into Program Evaluation.</p>
